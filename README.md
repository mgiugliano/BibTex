# BibTex Bibliography for Michele Giugliano 

This is my repository for academic writing support files.
It contains a large BibTeX format file, i.e. bib.bib, which I use.

It also contains two subfolders (csl_style and templates) containing 
style sheets and document templates for PanDoc. 
The (Pandoc) citation style sheet are from http://citationstyles.org
https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles

The folder scripts contains a couple of AppleScript files, used by BibDesk (macOs only).
See http://se-server.ethz.ch/staff/af/bibdesk/ for BibDesk scripts
Scripts must be copied in ~/Library/Application\ Support/BibDesk/Scripts/
(to become available from BibDesk top "Scripts" menu)

Useful command line trick:
cat file1 >> file 2 	(appends file1 to the end of file2)
