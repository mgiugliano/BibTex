The paper presents in vivo extracellular recordings from monkeys, engaged in motor tasks.
Both spikes and LFP are recorded simultaneously from multiple locations in the motor and
premotor cortices. The authors compute the STA (spike-triggered average) of the LFP and use the
first principal component analysis of it to reconstruct the firing rate of the spike trains.
This is achieved by a simple linear model, which is the weighted sum of the LFPs detected at
distinct microelectrodes. Authors show the accuracy of the prediction remains stable and valid
for several weeks to months (without requiring new coefficients to be learned).

The authors also show that providing to the monkey (reward) feedback on the LFP, the animal can
modulate the firing rate of one or two neurons independently, in closed-loop. Authors conclude that
a similar signal might be used in neuroprosthetics to obtain stable running estimates of the firing rate.
