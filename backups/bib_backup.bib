@article{Farries:2012,
	Abstract = {Experimental evidence indicates that the response of subthalamic neurons to excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) is well described by their infinitesimal phase response curves (iPRC). However, the factors controlling the shape of that iPRC, and hence controlling the way subthalamic neurons respond to synaptic input, are unclear. We developed a biophysical model of subthalamic neurons to aid in the understanding of their iPRCs; this model exhibited an iPRC type common to many subthalamic cells. We devised a method for deriving its iPRC from its biophysical properties that clarifies how these different properties interact to shape the iPRC. This method revealed why the response of subthalamic neurons is well approximated by their iPRCs and how that approximation becomes less accurate under strong fluctuating input currents. It also connected iPRC structure to aspects of cellular physiology that could be estimated in simple current-clamp experiments. This allowed us to directly compare the iPRC predicted by our theory with the iPRC estimated from the response to EPSPs or current pulses in individual cells. We found that theoretically predicted iPRCs agreed well with estimates derived from synaptic stimuli, but not with those estimated from the response to somatic current injection. The difference between synaptic currents and those applied experimentally at the soma may arise from differences in the dynamics of charge redistribution on the dendrites and axon. Ultimately, our approach allowed us to identify novel ways in which voltage-dependent conductances interact with AHP conductances to influence synaptic integration that will apply to a wide range of cell types.},

	Abstract = {Neural networks are more than the sum of their parts, but the properties of those parts are nonetheless important. For instance, neuronal properties affect the degree to which neurons receiving common input will spike synchronously, and whether that synchrony will propagate through the network. Stimulus-evoked synchrony can help or hinder network coding depending on the type of code. In this Perspective, we describe how spike initiation dynamics influence neuronal input-output properties, how those properties affect synchronization, and how synchronization affects network coding. We propose that synchronous and asynchronous spiking can be used to multiplex temporal (synchrony) and rate coding and discuss how pyramidal neurons would be well suited for that task.},

@article{Wilson:2014,
	Abstract = {We used phase resetting methods to predict firing patterns of rat subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons when their rhythmic firing was densely perturbed by noise. We applied sequences of contiguous brief (0.5-2 ms) current pulses with amplitudes drawn from a Gaussian distribution (10-100 pA standard deviation) to autonomously firing STN neurons in slices. Current noise sequences increased the variability of spike times with little or no effect on the average firing rate. We measured the infinitesimal phase resetting curve (PRC) for each neuron using a noise-based method. A phase model consisting of only a firing rate and PRC was very accurate at predicting spike timing, accounting for more than 80\% of spike time variance and reliably reproducing the spike-to-spike pattern of irregular firing. An approximation for the evolution of phase was used to predict the effect of firing rate and noise parameters on spike timing variability. It quantitatively predicted changes in variability of interspike intervals with variation in noise amplitude, pulse duration and firing rate over the normal range of STN spontaneous rates. When constant current was used to drive the cells to higher rates, the PRC was altered in size and shape and accurate predictions of the effects of noise relied on incorporating these changes into the prediction. Application of rate-neutral changes in conductance showed that changes in PRC shape arise from conductance changes known to accompany rate increases in STN neurons, rather than the rate increases themselves. Our results show that firing patterns of densely perturbed oscillators cannot readily be distinguished from those of neurons randomly excited to fire from the rest state. The spike timing of repetitively firing neurons may be quantitatively predicted from the input and their PRCs, even when they are so densely perturbed that they no longer fire rhythmically.},

	Abstract = {Oscillations of large populations of neurons are thought to be important in the normal functioning of the brain. We have used phase response curve (PRC) methods to characterize the dynamics of single neurons and predict population dynamics. Our past experimental work was limited to special circumstances (e.g., 2-cell networks of periodically firing neurons). Here, we explore the feasibility of extending our methods to predict the synchronization properties of stellate cells (SCs) in the rat entorhinal cortex under broader conditions. In particular, we test the hypothesis that PRCs in SCs scale linearly with changes in synaptic amplitude, and measure how well responses to Poisson process-driven inputs can be predicted in terms of PRCs. Although we see nonlinear responses to excitatory and inhibitory inputs, we find that models based on weak coupling account for scaling and Poisson process-driven inputs reasonably accurately.},

@article{Netoff:2005,
	Abstract = {Understanding the mechanistic bases of neuronal synchronization is a current challenge in quantitative neuroscience. We studied this problem in two putative cellular pacemakers of the mammalian hippocampal theta rhythm: glutamatergic stellate cells (SCs) of the medial entorhinal cortex and GABAergic oriens-lacunosum-molecular (O-LM) interneurons of hippocampal region CA1. We used two experimental methods. First, we measured changes in spike timing induced by artificial synaptic inputs applied to individual neurons. We then measured responses of free-running hybrid neuronal networks, consisting of biological neurons coupled (via dynamic clamp) to biological or virtual counterparts. Results from the single-cell experiments predicted network behaviors well and are compatible with previous model-based predictions of how specific membrane mechanisms give rise to empirically measured synchronization behavior. Both cell types phase lock stably when connected via homogeneous excitatory-excitatory (E-E) or inhibitory-inhibitory (I-I) connections. Phase-locked firing is consistently synchronous for either cell type with E-E connections and nearly anti-synchronous with I-I connections. With heterogeneous connections (e.g., excitatory-inhibitory, as might be expected if members of a given population had heterogeneous connections involving intermediate interneurons), networks often settled into phase locking that was either stable or unstable, depending on the order of firing of the two cells in the hybrid network. Our results imply that excitatory SCs, but not inhibitory O-LM interneurons, are capable of synchronizing in phase via monosynaptic mutual connections of the biologically appropriate polarity. Results are largely independent of synaptic strength and synaptic kinetics, implying that our conclusions are robust and largely unaffected by synaptic plasticity.},

	Abstract = {It is not known whether the variability of neural activity in the
cerebral cortex carries information or reflects noisy underlying
mechanisms. In an examination of the reliability of spike generation
using recordings from neurons in rat neocortical slices, the precision
of spike timing was found to depend on stimulus transients. Constant
stimuli led to imprecise spike trains, whereas stimuli with fluctuations
resembling synaptic activity produced spike trains with timing reproducible
to less than 1 millisecond. These data suggest a low intrinsic noise
level in spike generation, which could allow cortical neurons to
accurately transform synaptic input into spike sequences, supporting
a possible role for spike timing in the processing of cortical information
by the neocortex.},

	Abstract = {Voltage-gated ion channels in neuronal membranes fluctuate randomly
between different conformational states due to thermal agitation.
Fluctuations between conducting and nonconducting states give rise
to noisy membrane currents and subthreshold voltage fluctuations
and may contribute to variability in spike timing. Here we study
subthreshold voltage fluctuations due to active voltage-gated Na+
and K+ channels as predicted by two commonly used kinetic schemes:
the Mainen et al. (1995) (MJHS) kinetic scheme, which has been used
to model dendritic channels in cortical neurons, and the classical
Hodgkin-Huxley (1952) (HH) kinetic scheme for the squid giant axon.
We compute the magnitudes, amplitude distributions, and power spectral
densities of the voltage noise in isopotential membrane patches predicted
by these kinetic schemes. For both schemes, noise magnitudes increase
rapidly with depolarization from rest. Noise is larger for smaller
patch areas but is smaller for increased model temperatures. We contrast
the results from Monte Carlo simulations of the stochastic nonlinear
kinetic schemes with analytical, closed-form expressions derived
using passive and quasi-active linear approximations to the kinetic
schemes. For all subthreshold voltage ranges, the quasi-active linearized
approximation is accurate within 8\% and may thus be used in large-scale
simulations of realistic neuronal geometries.},

	Abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title><p>Computational modeling is of importance
in striving to understand the complex dynamic behavior of a neuron.
In neuronal modeling, the function of the neuron's components, including
the cell membrane and voltage-dependent ion channels, is typically
described using deterministic ordinary differential equations that
always provide the same model output when repeating computer simulations
with fixed model parameter values. It is well known, however, that
the behavior of neurons and voltage-dependent ion channels is stochastic
in nature. A stochastic modeling approach based on probabilistically
describing the transition rates of ion channels has therefore gained
interest due to its ability to produce more accurate results than
the deterministic approaches. These Markov chain type of models are,
however, relatively time-consuming to simulate. Thus it is important
to develop new modeling and simulation approaches that take into
account the stochasticity inherently present in the function of ion
channels. In this study, we seek new stochastic methods for modeling
the dynamic behavior of neurons. We apply stochastic differential
equations (SDEs) and Brownian motion that are also commonly used
in the air space industry and in economics. An SDE is a differential
equation in which one or more of the terms of the mathematical equation
are stochastic processes. Computer simulations show that the irregular
firing behavior of a small neuron, in our case the cerebellar granule
cell, is reproduced more accurately in comparison to previous deterministic
models. Furthermore, the computation is performed in a relatively
fast manner compared to previous stochastic approaches. Additionally,
the SDE method provides more sophisticated mathematical analysis
tools compared to other, similar kinds of stochastic approaches.
In the future, the new SDE model of the cerebellar granule cell can
be used in studying the emergent behavior of cerebellar neural network
circuitry.</p>},

to new ways of analyzing experimental data which may help in understanding
the mechanisms that underlie the phenomena. We show how the application
of fractals to analyze the patch clamp recordings of the sequence
of open and closed times of cell membrane ion channels has led to
a new description of ion channel kinetics. This new information has
led to new models that imply: (a) ion channel proteins have many
conformational states of nearly equal energy minima and many pathways
connecting one conformational state to another, and (b) that these
many states are not independent but are linked by physical mechanisms
that result in the observed fractal scaling. The first result is
consistent with many experiments, simulations, and theories of globular
proteins developed over the last decade. The second result has stimulated
the suggestion of several different physical mechanisms that could
cause the fractal scalings observed.},

between the open and closed states is an intrinsically random process.
Here, we present an alternative model based on a deterministic process.
This model is a piecewise linear iterated map. We calculate the dwell
time distributions, autocorrelation function, and power spectrum
of this map. We also explore non-linear generalizations of this map.
The chaotic nature of our model implies that its long-term behavior
mimics the stochastic properties of a random process. In particular,
the linear map produces an exponential probability distribution of
dwell times in the open and closed states, the same as that produced
by the two-state, closed in equilibrium open, Markov model. We show
how deterministic and random models can be distinguished by their
different phase space portraits. A test of some experimental data
seems to favor the deterministic model, but further experimental
evidence is needed for an unequivocal decision.},

the balance between excitation and inhibition during cortical activity.
Little is known, however, about the activation of these pathways
at the level of the local neocortical microcircuit. We report a disynaptic
inhibitory pathway among neocortical pyramidal cells (PCs). Inhibitory
responses were evoked in layer 5 PCs following stimulation of individual
neighboring PCs with trains of action potentials. The probability
for inhibition between PCs was more than twice that of direct excitation,
and inhibitory responses increased as a function of rate and duration
of presynaptic discharge. Simultaneous somatic and dendritic recordings
indicated that inhibition originated from PC apical and tuft dendrites.
Multineuron whole-cell recordings from PCs and interneurons combined
with morphological reconstructions revealed the mediating interneurons
as Martinotti cells. Martinotti cells received facilitating synapses
from PCs and formed reliable inhibitory synapses onto dendrites of
neighboring PCs. We describe this feedback pathway and propose it
as a central mechanism for regulation of cortical activity.},

	Abstract = {This book offers an introduction to current methods in computational modeling in neuroscience. The book describes realistic modeling methods at levels of complexity ranging from molecular interactions to large neural networks. A "how to" book rather than an analytical account, it focuses on the presentation of methodological approaches, including the selection of the appropriate method and its potential pitfalls. It is intended for experimental neuroscientists and graduate students who have little formal training in mathematical methods, but it will also be useful for scientists with theoretical backgrounds who want to start using data-driven modeling methods. The mathematics needed are kept to an introductory level; the first chapter explains the mathematical methods the reader needs to master to understand the rest of the book.

The chapters are written by scientists who have successfully integrated data-driven modeling with experimental work, so all of the material is accessible to experimentalists. The chapters offer comprehensive coverage with little overlap and extensive cross-references, moving from basic building blocks to more complex applications.},

@article{Karmarkar:2007,
	Abstract = {Decisions based on the timing of sensory events are fundamental to sensory processing. However, the mechanisms by which the brain measures time over ranges of milliseconds to seconds remain unclear. The dominant model of temporal processing proposes that an oscillator emits events that are integrated to provide a linear metric of time. We examine an alternate model in which cortical networks are inherently able to tell time as a result of time-dependent changes in network state. Using computer simulations we show that within this framework, there is no linear metric of time, and that a given interval is encoded in the context of preceding events. Human psychophysical studies were used to examine the predictions of the model. Our results provide theoretical and experimental evidence that, for short intervals, there is no linear metric of time, and that time may be encoded in the high-dimensional state of local neural networks.},

@article{Jacobson:2005,
	Abstract = {Neurones are noisy elements. Noise arises from both intrinsic and extrinsic sources, and manifests itself as fluctuations in the membrane potential. These fluctuations limit the accuracy of a neurone's output but have also been suggested to play a computational role. We present a detailed study of the amplitude and spectrum of voltage noise recorded at the soma of layer IV-V pyramidal neurones in slices taken from rat neocortex. The dependence of the noise on holding potential, synaptic activity and Na+ conductance is systematically analysed. We demonstrate that voltage noise increases non-linearly as the cell depolarizes (from a standard deviation (s.d.) of 0.19 mV at -75 mV to an s.d. of 0.54 mV at -55 mV). The increase in voltage noise is accompanied by an increase in the cell impedance, due to voltage dependence of Na+ conductance. The impedance increase accounts for the majority (70\%) of the voltage noise increase. The increase in voltage noise and impedance is restricted to the low-frequency range (0.2-2 Hz). At the high frequency range (5-100 Hz) the voltage noise is dominated by synaptic activity. In our slice preparation, synaptic noise has little effect on the cell impedance. A minimal model reproduces qualitatively these data. Our results imply that ion channel noise contributes significantly to membrane voltage fluctuations at the subthreshold voltage range, and that Na+ conductance plays a key role in determining the amplitude of this noise by acting as a voltage-dependent amplifier of low-frequency transients.},

	Abstract = {Markovkinetic models constitute a powerful framework to analyze patch-clamp data from single-channel recordings and model the dynamics of ion conductances and synaptic transmission between neurons. In particular, the accurate simulation of a large number of synaptic inputs in wide-scale network models may result in a computationally highly demanding process. We present a generalized consolidating algorithm to simulate efficiently a large number of synaptic inputs of the same kind (excitatory or inhibitory), converging on an isopotential compartment, independently modeling each synaptic current by a generic n-state Markov model characterized by piece-wise constant transition probabilities. We extend our findings to a class of simplified phenomenological descriptions of synaptic transmission that incorporate higher-order dynamics, such as short-term facilitation, depression, and synaptic plasticity.},

	Abstract = {As we have moved into the corporate sphere of Springer there were
	a number of changes, some subtle, some not so subtle. One change
	that is somewhat behind the scenes and eludes the eye of a reader
	is how Springer uses its distribution channels to spread the journal.
	Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines is now accessible in over
	5000 libraries across the globe. I think that speaks to the ability
	of this publisher, and its will to get the word out about our community.
	
	 In the absence of an officially calculated impact factor I have taken
	the initiative myself to address this issue. Using the citation base
	of Google Scholar, we have evaluated the impact of GPEM by looking
	at all the papers published since its inception in 2000, up to May
	2006. It turns out that authors did very well if publishing in GPEM.
	Their GPEM papers regularly featured prominently among their papers
	in terms of citations. 50% of our authors can count their GPEM paper
	among the first, second or third most cited paper of theirs. While
	this is certainly only true for half of the authors, it is indeed
	an achievement. So if you publish in GPEM, be prepared that your
	work is read, and also cited.},

	Abstract = {Background
	
	 Protein remote homology detection is a central problem in computational
	biology. Most recent methods train support vector machines to discriminate
	between related and unrelated sequences and these studies have introduced
	several types of kernels. One successful approach is to base a kernel
	on shared occurrences of discrete sequence motifs. Still, many protein
	sequences fail to be classified correctly for a lack of a suitable
	set of motifs for these sequences. Results
	
	 We introduce the GPkernel, which is a motif kernel based on discrete
	sequence motifs where the motifs are evolved using genetic programming.
	All proteins can be grouped according to evolutionary relations and
	structure, and the method uses this inherent structure to create
	groups of motifs that discriminate between different families of
	evolutionary origin. When tested on two SCOP benchmarks, the superfamily
	and fold recognition problems, the GPkernel gives significantly better
	results compared to related methods of remote homology detection.
	Conclusion
	
	 The GPkernel gives particularly good results on the more difficult
	fold recognition problem compared to the other methods. This is mainly
	because the method creates motif sets that describe similarities
	among subgroups of both the related and unrelated proteins. This
	rich set of motifs give a better description of the similarities
	and differences between different folds than do previous motif-based
	methods.},

@article{Muttil:2007:EAAI,
	Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms, which are considered a serious environmental
	problem nowadays, occur in coastal waters in many parts of the world.
	They cause acute ecological damage and ensuing economic losses, due
	to fish kills and shellfish poisoning as well as public health threats
	posed by toxic blooms. Recently, data-driven models including machine-learning
	(ML) techniques have been employed to mimic dynamics of algal blooms.
	One of the most important steps in the application of a ML technique
	is the selection of significant model input variables. In the present
	paper, we use two extensively used ML techniques, artificial neural
	networks (ANN) and genetic programming (GP) for selecting the significant
	input variables. The efficacy of these techniques is first demonstrated
	on a test problem with known dependence and then they are applied
	to a real-world case study of water quality data from Tolo Harbour,
	Hong Kong. These ML techniques overcome some of the limitations of
	the currently used techniques for input variable selection, a review
	of which is also presented. The interpretation of the weights of
	the trained ANN and the GP evolved equations demonstrate their ability
	to identify the ecologically significant variables precisely. The
	significant variables suggested by the ML techniques also indicate
	chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) itself to be the most significant input in
	predicting the algal blooms, suggesting an auto-regressive nature
	or persistence in the algal bloom dynamics, which may be related
	to the long flushing time in the semi-enclosed coastal waters. The
	study also confirms the previous understanding that the algal blooms
	in coastal waters of Hong Kong often occur with a life cycle of the
	order of 1-2 weeks.},

@article{oai:biomedcentral.com:1471-2105-7-16,
	Abstract = {Background Methods for predicting protein function directly from amino
	acid sequences are useful tools in the study of uncharacterised protein
	families and in comparative genomics. Until now, this problem has
	been approached using machine learning techniques that attempt to
	predict membership, or otherwise, to predefined functional categories
	or subcellular locations. A potential drawback of this approach is
	that the human-designated functional classes may not accurately reflect
	the underlying biology, and consequently important sequence-to-function
	relationships may be missed. Results We show that a self-supervised
	data mining approach is able to find relationships between sequence
	features and functional annotations. No preconceived ideas about
	functional categories are required, and the training data is simply
	a set of protein sequences and their UniProt/Swiss-Prot annotations.
	The main technical aspect of the approach is the co-evolution of
	amino acid-based regular expressions and keyword-based logical expressions
	with genetic programming. Our experiments on a strictly non-redundant
	set of eukaryotic proteins reveal that the strongest and most easily
	detected sequence-to-function relationships are concerned with targeting
	to various cellular compartments, which is an area already well studied
	both experimentally and computationally. Of more interest are a number
	of broad functional roles which can also be correlated with sequence
	features. These include inhibition, biosynthesis, transcription and
	defence against bacteria. Despite substantial overlaps between these
	functions and their corresponding cellular compartments, we find
	clear differences in the sequence motifs used to predict some of
	these functions. For example, the presence of polyglutamine repeats
	appears to be linked more strongly to the {"}transcription{"} function
	than to the general {"}nuclear{"} function/location. Conclusion We
	have developed a novel and useful approach for knowledge discovery
	in annotated sequence data. The technique is able to identify functionally
	important sequence features and does not require expert knowledge.
	By viewing protein function from a sequence perspective, the approach
	is also suitable for discovering unexpected links between biological
	processes, such as the recently discovered role of ubiquitination
	in transcription.},

	Abstract = {Markov kinetic models were used to synthesize a complete description of synaptic transmission, including opening of voltage-dependent channels in the presynaptic terminal, release of neurotransmitter, gating of postsynaptic receptors, and activation of second-messenger systems. These kinetic schemes provide a more general framework for modeling ion channels than the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, supporting a continuous spectrum of descriptions ranging from the very simple and computationally efficient to the highly complex and biophysically precise. Examples are given of simple kinetic schemes based on fits to experimental data that capture the essential properties of voltage-gated, synaptic and neuromodulatory currents. The Markov formalism allows the dynamics of ionic currents to be considered naturally in the larger context of biochemical signal transduction. This framework can facilitate the integration of a wide range of experimental data and promote consistent theoretical analysis of neural mechanisms from molecular interactions to network computations.},

	Abstract = {We explore a synaptic plasticity model that incorporates recent findings
	that potentiation and depression can be induced by precisely timed
	pairs of synaptic events and postsynaptic spikes. In addition we
	include the observation that strong synapses undergo relatively less
	potentiation than weak synapses, whereas depression is independent
	of synaptic strength. After random stimulation, the synaptic weights
	reach an equilibrium distribution which is stable, unimodal, and
	has positive skew. This weight distribution compares favorably to
	the distributions of quantal amplitudes and of receptor number observed
	experimentally in central neurons and contrasts to the distribution
	found in plasticity models without size-dependent potentiation. Also
	in contrast to those models, which show strong competition between
	the synapses, stable plasticity is achieved with little competition.
	Instead, competition can be introduced by including a separate mechanism
	that scales synaptic strengths multiplicatively as a function of
	postsynaptic activity. In this model, synaptic weights change in
	proportion to how correlated they are with other inputs onto the
	same postsynaptic neuron. These results indicate that stable correlation-based
	plasticity can be achieved without introducing competition, suggesting
	that plasticity and competition need not coexist in all circuits
	or at all developmental stages.},

@article{Babadi2010,
	Abstract = {Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a widespread synaptic modification
	mechanism, is sensitive to correlations between presynaptic spike
	trains and it generates competition among synapses. However, STDP
	has an inherent instability because strong synapses are more likely
	to be strengthened than weak ones, causing them to grow in strength
	until some biophysical limit is reached. Through simulations and
	analytic calculations, we show that a small temporal shift in the
	STDP window that causes synchronous, or nearly synchronous, pre-
	and postsynaptic action potentials to induce long-term depression
	can stabilize synaptic strengths. Shifted STDP also stabilizes the
	postsynaptic firing rate and can implement both Hebbian and anti-Hebbian
	forms of competitive synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, the overall
	level of inhibition determines whether plasticity is Hebbian or anti-Hebbian.
	Even a random symmetric jitter of a few milliseconds in the STDP
	window can stabilize synaptic strengths while retaining these features.
	The same results hold for a shifted version of the more recent "triplet"
	model of STDP. Our results indicate that the detailed shape of the
	STDP window function near the transition from depression to potentiation
	is of the utmost importance in determining the consequences of STDP,
	suggesting that this region warrants further experimental study.},

	Abstract = {Memory systems should be plastic to allow for learning; however, they
	should also retain earlier memories. Here we explore how synaptic
	weights and memories are retained in models of single neurons and
	networks equipped with spike-timing-dependent plasticity. We show
	that for single neuron models, the precise learning rule has a strong
	effect on the memory retention time. In particular, a soft-bound,
	weight-dependent learning rule has a very short retention time as
	compared with a learning rule that is independent of the synaptic
	weights. Next, we explore how the retention time is reflected in
	receptive field stability in networks. As in the single neuron case,
	the weight-dependent learning rule yields less stable receptive fields
	than a weight-independent rule. However, receptive fields stabilize
	in the presence of sufficient lateral inhibition, demonstrating that
	plasticity in networks can be regulated by inhibition and suggesting
	a novel role for inhibition in neural circuits.},
